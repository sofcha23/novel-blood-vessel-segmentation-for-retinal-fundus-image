\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



\usepackage{amssymb}

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
The retina is unique in the body for allowing easy observation of blood vessels with simple, non-invasive instruments.It is also the only accessible site for studying the central nervous system non invasively.Hence Retinal fundus images play an important role for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular,neurological and ophthalmologic diseases.However, the manual analysis of the retinal fundus image is time-consuming and needs the empirical knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary for developing automatic analysis of retinal fundus images. Retinal blood vessel segmentation is the fundamental work of retinal fundus images analysis because some attributes of retinal blood vessels ,such as width, branching pattern etc are important symptoms of diseases..Hence we propose to use the various techniques of image processing to reduce the noise and improve the quality of retinal images so as to get a much more accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels thus helping ophthalmologists in early detection of life threatening diseases like macular degeneration,diabetic retinopathy,stroke,heart ailments ,hypertension etc.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
At Present, the advances on digital imaging systems offer very high-resolution images that can be used in several areas of medicine.In order to build a human disease feature database for the service of automated diagnosis, it is an important step to detect the blood vessels in the retina image processing as the eye is a window to the retinal vascular system which is uniquely accessible for the non-invasive, in vivo study of a complete vascular bed in humans. The detection and measurement of blood vessels can be used to quantify the severity of disease or as part of the process of automated diagnosis of diseases.

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the diseases that can be detected using retinal blood vessel segmentation. Diabetic retinopathy occurs due to leakage of small vessels in retina related to prolonged period of hyperglycemia. It can be classified into two stages: Nonproliferative retinopathy and proliferative retinopathy. Nonproliferative retinopathy is the early stage of the disease which includes hemorrhage and exudates. Hemorrhage results from capillaries bleeding while exudates results from the accumulation of proteins and lipids in the retina. Proliferative retinopathy is the advance stage of the disease that new abnormal vessels, called neovascularization are grown in the retina. This can lead to problems in vision. There are many methods for the segmentation of blood vessels, some of them are Image Line Cross Section(ILCS),Edge Enhancement and Edge Detection(EEED), Modified Match Filtering(MMF) , Continuation Algorithm(CA).

In this paper we present the idea of segmenting the blood vessel using morphological and contour operations.

\section{Literature review}
As diabetes is common in many countries especially like India, there are almost 62 million people affected by this.In recent years there has been a lot of research going on this field to detect them in the early stages and preventing it as early as possible. 

The diagnosis of the fundus image is widely used in many medical diagnosis and Image segmentation of fundus image is the important in identifying the retinal pathology, these analysis helps opthamologists to identify the retinal disease. The changes in the blood vessel and the retinal pathology can be identified by first segmenting the retinal
vessels and by proper analysis of the retinal blood vessels.

Automatic segmentation of retinal vessels is important for detection of early diseases.There are various methods for segmenting the retinal vessels in fundus image, some of them are:

Vessel segmentation using Max-Tree to represent the image based on its gray level afterwards the filtering process is done using branches filtering approach in which the tree branches is selected based on the elongation attribute of the nodes for which the selection starts from the leaf nodes.

Another segmentation process includes segmentation of retinal vessels using the Mumford-Shah model and Gabor wavelet filter. Extraction of retinal blood vessels is done using Weiner filter and Morphological operations like opening and closing.

Retinal segmentation based on reinforcement local description . A novel line set feature first captures local shape information about vessel by employing length prior of vessels. After that, local intensity feature is calculated for each pixel and morphological gradient feature is extracted for enhancing local edge of smaller vessel, finally line set based feature, local intensity feature and morphological gradient feature are combined to obtain the reinforcement local description.

In this paper we present the idea of segmentation of retinal blood vessel using morphological operations and contour algorithm. The fundus image used in this research is obtained from Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction(DRIVE dataset). Input to segmentation process is color fundus image and RGB image is converted to green channel image and morphological operations is used, lastly contour algorithm is applied on the image to get segmented image with accuracy averaging around 95\%.


\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Pre-processing}
%Subsection text here.
Red-green-blue (RGB) fundus images usually come up
with low contrast and noisy background. Therefore, blood
vessels, especially the thin ones, need to be enhanced to get
new modified images that are more suitable for the
segmentation process [2]. The pre-processing performs
global vessel enhancement and morphological methodology
with image denoising
\\\\
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
\textit{1) Green channel extraction:}\\
The green channel of the original image has more details
than the red and blue channels. Thus, it is better to have it as
a reference image for the segmentation process. Red and
blue channels do not provide clear blood vessels due to the
low contrast and poor dynamic range, respectively[3]
\\
\begin{figure}[]
\includegraphics[width= \linewidth]{4.PNG}
\end{figure}
\\ 
\textit{2) Green channel complement and adaptive histogram
equalization:}\\
In this study, adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) is
used since it tends to enhance the low contrast of an image
by uniformly spreading the image intensity levels. Instead of
processing the entire image data, it processes small regions,
individually[4].The AHE equalizes intensity levels by
making vessels, including the small ones, clearer and whiter
As a result, the image has a smoothed background.%
\\ 

  
\subsection{Morphological operations}

Morphological methodologies are collection of techniques
used in extracting components of an image [5]. The most
basic morphological operations defined are erosion and
dilation. Assuming the object X and the structuring element
B are represented as sets in 2D Euclidian space. 
Let Bx denote the translation of B so that its origin is located at x. Then the erosion of X by B is defined as the set of all points x such that Bx is included in X, that is,
\[X \bigodot B = \{x:B_{x} \subseteq X\}\] 
In the same way, the dilation of X by B is described as the
set of all points x such that Bx hits X that is, they have a
nonempty intersection 
\[X\bigoplus B = \{x:B_{x} \bigcap X \neq \emptyset \}  \]

Erosion is a shrinking operation, whereas dilation is an
expansion operation. The erosion followed by dilation is
called opening. It is defined in Eq.3 below. 
\[X_{b} = (X \bigodot B)\bigoplus B \]

Similarly , The dilation followed by erosion is
called closing. It is defined in Eq.4 below.
\[X_{b} = (X \bigoplus B) \bigodot B \]

The blood vessels are suppressed by the successive
‘opening’ and 'closing' operation with a structuring element that is nonflat and ball-shaped, to create a background.This background is used to achieve a normalized image.The created background is subtracted from the
result of the adaptive histogram equalizer, to obtain a
normalized retinal image.
Adaptive histogram equalization is  applied to the resultant image.
\\
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width= \linewidth]{3.png}
\caption{Series of opening and closing operations and subtraction}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Removal of non-connected components}
Contour tracing is one of many  techniques performed on digital images in order to extract information about their general shape.\\
Contour tracing is done to group the various connected components in the image, this data is again processed to check whether the components are blood vessels or whether it is noise ,and also non-connected components are removed.\\
initially contour tracing is done on the binary image and various components are obtained as a list.Then the list traversed to check the area of various components,if the area of the component is less than 200 pixel ,then mask is drawn over it,after this step erosion is done ,and thus small dots and noise is removed from the image.



%The above mathematical operations are clarified using a
%flowchart shown in Fig.5.



\section{Results}
\subsection{Dataset}
The images of the drive datasets were obtained from the research website online used for retinal vessel extraction. Each image was captured using 8 bits per color plane at 768 by 584 pixels. The field of view (FOV) of each image is circular with a diameter of approximately 540 pixels. For this database, the images have been cropped around the FOV.The set of 40 images has been divided into a training and a test set, both containing 20 images. For the training images, a single manual segmentation of image is used.  
\subsection{Implementation details}
The implementation of the above methodology was done using opencv python. Firstly reading the image from the parent directory and applying the color scale conversion from BGR->GRAY and followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization(CLAHE) with grid size of around 8X8 to improve the contrast of the image. Series of morphological operations is applied with varying structuring Element size for the image. The image obtained after these operations is subtracted from the original enhanced contrast image and followed by binary threshold operation where minval is set to 15 and maxval is set to 255. Last step is applying the Contour watershed algorithm to identify boundary connected blood vessel for improving accuracy. 
\subsection{Accuracy}
Performance of segmentation of blood vessel is measured by calculating accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity of the image. Parameters used for calculation are True Positive(TR), False Positive(FP), False Negative(FN) and False Poitive(FP).

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{CONTINGENCY VESSEL CLASSIFICATION}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|r} % <-- Alignments: 1st column left, 2nd middle and 3rd right, with vertical lines in between
      \textbf{} & \textbf{Vessel Present} & \textbf{Vessel Absent}\\

      \hline
       &True Positive(TP) & False Positive(FP)\\
       & False Negative(FN) & True Negative(TN)\\

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Accuracy =  \(\frac{TN + TP}{TN + TP + FN +FP + 1 }\)\\

Sensitivity = \(\frac{TP}{TP + FN + 1}\)\\

Specificity = \(\frac{TN}{TN + FP + 1}\)\\

Results are calculated by comparing each pixel value of segmented image to that of corresponding manual image in DRIVE dataset.If testing image pixel value is white and if the pixel value of both images match then True Positive(TP) gets incremented else it will increment False Negative (FN).
If it is not white and stil matches then True negative (TN) will increment else False Positive (FP) will increase by one. This will done for all the pixel values. After calculating all the terms Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity will be calculated using the formula and results are displayed.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
